## add any imports


## Write functions for each operation

## Write functions for three operand operations

## Write get_num() function that returns a parsed int

## Write a print_result() function that prints the result of the operation


## Write a main() function that performs all of the user interaction and the
## runtime logic

  ## have the user choose an operator

  ## ask for two or three operands

  ## get the first and second operands

  ## get the third operand if they wanted three

  ## call the appropriate function based on their operator and number of
  ## operands and print result


# this makes it so that when you run your file that it will call the main
# function. It is always good practice to do this. We put all of the runtime
# functionality in the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
